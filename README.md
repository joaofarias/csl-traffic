# Traffic++
A WIP mod for Cities: Skylines to improve traffic.

Caution: If used, the new road types will be included in your save games... which means you'll need Traffic++ to load them. If you want to disable all Traffic++ features, but still open those save games, enable Ghost Mode in the mod options.

# Objective
The goal of this mod is to improve traffic in Cities: Skylines by adding new roads, vehicles, tools and behaviours.

# Current Features
- New Road Types:
	- Six-lane road with bus lanes
	- Two-lane busway
	- Suburban Road (Pedestrianised, Zoneable)
	- Rural Lane (Pedestrianised, Zoneable)
- Road Customiser Tool:
	- Intersection lane editor
	- Vehicle restrictions
	- Speed restrictions
- Other Features:
	- Multi-track Station Enabler (via Sims Firehouse)
	- Realistic Speeds (optional)
	- Prevent vehicle despawn (optional, via CBeTHaX)

# Roadmap
